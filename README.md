# Unit2Project-LinearEquationSolver
Program asks for two string inputs: two distinct coordinates. With these coords, the program will repeat the points inputted, as well as printing out the slope-intercept equation, slope, y-intercept, and distance between the points. After that, the program was ask the user for a double value, representing an x value. It will then use that x-value to print out a full coordinate with said x-value based on the slope-intercept equation printed earlier.
